# Express.js Route Parameter Validation for Numeric IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  improper handling of non-numeric IDs in path parameters.  The original code lacks validation, leading to unexpected errors when non-numeric IDs are used.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with input validation.
